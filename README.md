# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques. AQI is an important indicator that reflects the level of air pollution and its possible impact on human health. By analyzing environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentration, the model predicts the AQI category to help in monitoring and decision-making.

## 📌 Project Objective
- To collect, clean, and analyze air quality and weather data.
- To train a machine learning model that predicts AQI values with reasonable accuracy.
- To visualize air pollution trends and model performance metrics.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Air pollution and weather data were collected from reliable sources such as government pollution monitoring sites or open datasets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing unnecessary columns  
   - Feature encoding and scaling  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding pollutant patterns  
   - Studying correlation between weather and AQI  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Train-test split  
   - Random Forest / Regression / Other ML models applied  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - MAE, RMSE  
   - Visualization of results

## 🔍 Model Used
**Random Forest Regressor**  
Chosen due to its ability to handle complex non-linear relationships and large number of features with high accuracy.

---

## 📊 Visualizations (Optional Dashboard)
If a dashboard was created (e.g., in Power BI), it displays:
- Pollutant concentration trends
- AQI category distribution
- Scatter plots: Wind speed vs AQI, Temperature vs AQI
- Model prediction comparison

---

## ✅ Results
The model successfully predicts AQI with acceptable accuracy and can be further improved with:
- More historical data
- Deep learning techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning

---

## 📎 Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model using Flask / Streamlit web app
- Create real-time AQI monitoring dashboard
- Integrate live API air quality feed
